This repository hosts active installation badges for all Home Assistant custom components. A GitHub action is used to update them on a daily basis.

## Templates

If you like to have a custom template for your integration, please open a pull request with the new template.
The default template was taken from <https://img.shields.io/badge/Active_installations-XXXXX-orange?style=for-the-badge>
