This repository hosts active installation badges for all my Home Assistant custom components. A GitHub action is used to update them on a daily basis.

I was inspired by the [hacs-statistics-badge](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/hacs-statistics-badge) project made by [@KartoffelToby](https://github.com/KartoffelToby), thanks for sharing!
